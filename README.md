# 🏪 VUE CHALLENGE | JSF 03 👔

## 🛒 Introduction
In this project, I built an e-commerce application to test my skills with VUe. It offers a smooth browsing experience, quick loading times, and an attractive design using Vue's efficient reactivity and component-based architecture.

## 🤖 Technologies
The app is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Structuring components and pages.
- CSS3: Styling with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach.
- JavaScript: Managing logic, interactions, and API requests.
- Vue.js: Framework for building the app's user interface with a reactive and component-based approach.
- Pinia: For state management, handling data such as product lists and applied filters.
- Vite: A build tool for fast development and efficient bundling.
- Fakestore API: A free API providing e-commerce product data.
